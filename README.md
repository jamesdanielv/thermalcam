also check out work on mlx90640 sensor https://github.com/jamesdanielv/thermal_cam_mlx90640


Notice: next update will include a upsample.h that will move upscale into its own folder. this also will allow for compatablity without need for modified display drivers.

I only officially support st7735 128x128 sold by adafruit and ili9341 320x240 displays. these are the only ones with display drivers i have modified for fast acceleration. there are universal drivers im working on, but i don't know when released.

i also have created drivers that support 128x160 displays. but i do not officially support them!
